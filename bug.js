This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library on Android.  The issue is that after selecting an image, the app crashes with a `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'response.assets[0].uri')` error.  This happens inconsistently; sometimes it works fine, other times it crashes immediately after selecting an image. The problem seems related to the asynchronous nature of the ImagePicker and how it handles the response. The `response` object sometimes arrives before the assets are fully populated, leading to the error. This error occurs even with the latest versions of Expo and react-native.
